###### ⚠️ This project is for educational purposes only, if you use this on any transit system, Metro or Sound Transit, that is your fault as you potentially breaking public trust, when you can humbly ask for a ride, or stealing service from a 3rd party transit service, and is against the law
# [![Build Status](https://github.com/izryel/co.bytemark.tgt.cf/raw/main/status.svg)](https://github.com/izryel/co.bytemark.tgt.cf)
# Scope:
> Any non-NFC method to reduce potential for stolen fare is below industry best-practices, being that, visual validation is circumnavigatable due to human error, and laser scanning barcodes can be tricked, even if encrypted, by well reverse engineer decryped data-strings, and regenerated with barcode generators.

#### To-do (In progress tasks):
- Collect aztec codes from ticket app for a more complete reverse engineering database
- Implement a prompt to ask user what the tranfer color/letter of the day is to legimize produced digital counterfeit
-- Which can be sourced through crowd sourced social media groups/pages.

#### Goals (Incipient tasks):
- Be able to socially engineer fare upon visual inspection by driver, record and log for submittal.
- Pass a fare-enforecement Aztec Barcode scan for fare proof-of-purchase, record and log for submittal.
- Somehow make the transfer of the day more automatic with a curl script for social media page content.
